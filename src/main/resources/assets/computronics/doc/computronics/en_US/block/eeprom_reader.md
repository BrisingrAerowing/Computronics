# EEPROM Reader

![Wait, don't we already have EEPROMs?](block:computronics:computronics.eepromReader)

The EEPROM reader allows computers to read from and write to EEPROMs added by NedoComputers. The EEPROM is inserted onto the top face of the EEPROM reader, and can be accessed using the `eeprom_reader` component.
