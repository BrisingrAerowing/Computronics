# Cassette Tape

Cassette tapes are used for recording and playback of audio using the [tape drive](../block/tape_drive.md). Tapes come in varying lengths from 2 to 128 minutes, and can also be used to store other types of information (in which case, storage space ranging from 1 to 8 MB). Audio is recorded using the DFPWM format, as detailed in the [tape drive](../block/tape_drive.md) document.
