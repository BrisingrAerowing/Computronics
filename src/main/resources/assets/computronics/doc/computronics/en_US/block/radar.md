# Radar

The radar block behaves similarly to the motion sensor in Open Computers, allowing detection of entities such as players, mobs, and dropped items. The built in API functions return a table of entity names and distances within a specified range (with the option of returning distances relative to the radar block). 

The radar block requires a certain amount of power for scanning larger areas (with Open Computers), or has a delay between scans (ComputerCraft).
