# Beep Card

![Beep. Beep. Beep.](item:computronics:computronics.ocParts@5)

The Beep card provides the `beep()` function, which takes a table of frequency-duration pairs as an input, up to eight entries at once. The beep card plays each frequency of beeps for the specified duration. Once one frequency has finished playing it is possible to give a new frequency-duration pair to the beep card. You can never play more than eight frequencies simultaneously.
